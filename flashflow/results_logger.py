''' Helper functions for writing per-second measurement results to a file that
might rotate, as well as classes for reading those results from files later.

**Note: The information here is only partially true until pastly/flashflow#4 is
implemented and this message is removed.**

Results are "logged" via :mod:`logging` at level ``INFO``. It is important that
the user does not edit the way these messages are logged.
If the user would like to rotate the output file, e.g. with `logrotate
<https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate>`_, they can do that because by default
(*and this should not be changed lightly*) these "log messages" get "logged"
via a :class:`logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler`, which handles this
situation gracefully.

Usage
=====

Call :meth:`write_begin` once at the beginning of the active measurement phase.
As measurement results come in every second from measurers, call
:meth:`write_meas` for each. Likewise for per-second background traffic reports
and :meth:`write_bg`.  As soon as active measurement is over, call
:meth:`write_end`.

Output Format
=============

Output is line based. Multiple measurements can take place simultaneously, in
which case per-second results from measurements of different relays can be
interleaved.

A **BEGIN** line signals the start of data for the measurement of a relay. An
**END** line signals the end. Between these lines there are zero or more result
lines for the measurement of this relay, each with a per-second result from
either a measurer measuring that relay or that relay itself reporting the
amount of background traffic it saw that second.

BEGIN Line
----------

::

    <fp> <meas_id> <time> BEGIN

Where:

- ``fp``: the fingerprint of the relay this BEGIN message is for.
- ``meas_id``: the measurement ID for this measurement
- ``time``: the integer unix timestamp at which active measurement began.

Example::

    B0430D21D6609459D141078C0D7758B5CA753B6F 58234 1591979504 BEGIN

END line
--------

::

    <fp> <meas_id> <time> END

Where:

- ``fp``: the fingerprint of the relay this END message is for.
- ``meas_id``: the measurement ID for this measurement
- ``time``: the integer unix timestamp at which active measurement ended.

Example::

    B0430D21D6609459D141078C0D7758B5CA753B6F 58234 1591979534 END


Results line
------------

::

    <fp> <meas_id> <time> <is_bg> GIVEN=<given> TRUSTED=<trusted>

Where:

- ``fp``: the fingerprint of the relay.
- ``meas_id``: the measurement ID for this measurement
- ``time``: the integer unix timestamp at which this result was received.
- ``is_bg``: 'BG' if this result is a report from the relay on the number of
  background bytes it saw in the last second, or 'MEASR' if this is a result
  from a measurer
- ``given``: the number of bytes reported
- ``trusted``: if a bg report from the relay, the maximum `given` is trusted to
  be; or if a measurer result, then the same as `given`.

Both ``given`` and ``trusted`` are in bytes. Yes, for measurer lines it is
redundant to specify both.

Background traffic reports from the relay include the raw actual reported value
in ``given``; if the relay is malicious and claims 8 TiB of background traffic
in the last second, you will see that here. ``trusted`` is the **max** that
``given`` can be. When reading results from this file, use ``min(given,
trusted)`` as the trusted number of background bytes this second.

Example::

    # bg report from relay, use GIVEN b/c less than TRUSTED
    B0430D21D6609459D141078C0D7758B5CA753B6F 58234 1591979083 BG GIVEN=744904 TRUSTED=1659029
    # bg report from relay, use TRUSTED b/c less than GIVEN
    B0430D21D6609459D141078C0D7758B5CA753B6F 58234 1591979042 BG GIVEN=671858 TRUSTED=50960
    # result from measurer, always trusted
    B0430D21D6609459D141078C0D7758B5CA753B6F 58234 1591979083 MEASR GIVEN=5059082 TRUSTED=5059082

    Not much is done to ensure you're using this data storage class correctly.
    For example:

        - You can add more :class:`MeasLineData` after marking the end.
        - You can pass untrusted :class:`MeasLineData` from the relay to the
            :meth:`Meas.add_measr` function where they will be treated as
            trusted.
        - You can get the :meth:`Meas.result` before all data lines have been
            given.
        - You can provide data from different measurements for different
            relays.
