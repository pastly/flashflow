'''
This is the collection of Tor Control Port commands that now exist in Tor
thanks to Flashflow but for which Stem does not yet implement a better
interface.

All messages must be of the ABC TorCtrlMsg and provide its methods. Most
notably this means the __str__ method, which is used to turn the message into a
string for sending to the ControlPort.

New messages are free to have a more complex construction process than simply
passing in all necessary information at __init__ time. But at the end of the
day they need to implement all TorCtrlMsg's methods and have a __str__ that
turns them into a one-line string for sending to Tor.
