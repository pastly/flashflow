# Adding a new command

Like `flashflow coord` and `flashflow measurer`.

The working example here is a new command called `jeff`.

## Create a new file in `flashflow/cmd/`

`flashflow/cmd/jeff.py`

## Add boilerplate to new file

You need to:

- create a `log` object so you can log things
- define a `gen_parser(...)` function to call to attach your command's
  arguments to the global argument parser
- define a `main(...)` function

Here's a clean example that works at the time of writring.  Look at the
existing FlashFlow commands for examples that (1) definitely stay updated with
how FlashFlow functions, and (2) may be more complex than this.

    from argparse import ArgumentParser
    import logging
    
    
    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    
    def gen_parser(sub) -> ArgumentParser:
        ''' Add the cmd line options for this FlashFlow command '''
        d = 'The example FlashFlow command known as jeff'
        p = sub.add_parser('jeff', description=d)
        return p
    
    
    # This function needs **some sort** of type annotation so that mypy will check
    # the things it does. Adding the return value (e.g. '-> None') is enough
    def main(args, conf) -> None:
        log.error('Hi I'm jeff, and I am boilerplate. Make me do something useful')


## Import new file in `flashflow/flashflow.py`

In the imports at the top of `flashflow/flashflow.py` find where other commands
are being imported. Import yours too. For example:

    # ... other imports of flashflow commands
    import flashflow.cmd.jeff

## Call your new `gen_parser(...)` in `flashflow/flashflow.py`

Find `create_parser(...)` in `flashflow/flashflow.py` and find where other
commands are getting their subparsers added. Do the same.

    # ... other lines calling commands' `gen_parser()` function
    flashflow.cmd.jeff.gen_parser(sub)
    return p

## Add a call to your new `main(...)` in `flashflow/flashflow.py`.

Find `call_real_main(...)` in `flashflow/flashflow.py`. In it find the
dictionary of all possible commands and the arguments to pass to them. Add your
new command.

    cmds = {
        # ... other commands
        'jeff': {
            'f': flashflow.cmd.jeff.main,
            'a': def_args, 'kw': def_kwargs,
        },
    }

## Done

That's it. You should be able to do things such as the following and see `jeff`
show up.

    flashflow jeff
    flashflow jeff -h
    flashflow -h
